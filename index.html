    Space weather is a blanket term used to describe the events and conditions between the earth’s surface to magnetic and the sun. 
    Space weather events such as solar flares, coronal mass ejections and solar radiation storms can all affect electronics such as satellites 
    and the electrical grid, they can also sometimes impact human health. There are many preventative methods that can be utilised to reduce 
    these impacts though to the extent of which they are significant  may vary depending on the solar event. On the whole however the preventative 
    methods are improving which only increases their effectiveness for the future and extreme solar events are exceedingly rare, only occurring
    a couple of times per solar cycle. This means that the overall significance of solar storms is quite moderate
